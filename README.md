1. Description of Experimented Change
At the shop list view on wayfair shopping site , it provides two card display modes: one is when there is a quick view button when the mouse is hovered over, and one is not.


When users encounter a quick view button, they can click and view the details && specific sku information to customize combinations, providing them with more information whether they enter the next detail page.

Users without quick view button need to click directly to see detailed sku information


2. Experiment Hypothesis
The hypothesis is that this can provide users with more information about deciding whether or not to make a final purchase, thereby reducing the number of situations where there is insufficient information and one more click to enter the details to opt out without buying. The quick view button can significantly increase the conversion rate of the product detail page, improve the user's buying law, and optimize the user experience.

3. Experiment Details
The unit of diversion is a cookie. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.
